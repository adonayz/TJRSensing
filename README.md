# TJR Sensing
TJR sensing is an application that collects gait data from patients that had Total Joint Replacement surgery. This application is a modified version of an application named AlcoGaitDataGatherer. AlcoGaitDataGatherer is an android application that is used to collect gait data (walking behavior) from test subjects via sensors in smartphones and wearable Android devices. The TJR Sensing application was built by applying modifications to the walk type and walk number system from the AlcoGaitDataGatherer application. The wearable feature was also completely removed since it was not required for the scope of this project.
